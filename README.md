# The Subcomponent Problem

In building games or any game that has a crafting system, the question of whether the player has enough resources to craft an item or finish a project can become difficult to answer. Items have components that often must also be crafted and have recipes of their own. This is the essence of the Subcomponent Problem.

## Turtles All the Way Down

Well, not quite. There are two types of items in The Subcomponent Problem.

**Base items** are fundamental items. These either are harvested or have crafting requirements that are simple enough not track, i.e. raw ore.

**Recipes** are crafted from base items. They have a list of ingredients that may either be raw items or other crafted items as well as a quantity crafted (defaults to 1).
